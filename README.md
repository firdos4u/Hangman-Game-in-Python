# Hangman-Game-in-Python
 Hangman program randomly selects a secret word from a list of secret words(fruit name). When a letter in that word is guessed correctly, that letter position in the word is made visible. In this way, all letters of the word are to be guessed before all the chances are over. For convenience, we have given length of word + 2 chances. For example, word to be guessed is mango, then user gets 5 + 2 = 7 chances, as mango is a five letter word.
 
Available list of word:
apple banana mango strawberry 
orange grape pineapple apricot lemon coconut watermelon
cherry papaya berry peach lychee muskmelon
